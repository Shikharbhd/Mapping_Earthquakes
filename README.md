# MAPPING EARTHQUAKE CHALLENGE

### Overview of the Project:

The purpose of this project is to visually plot the earthquake data in relation to the tectonic platesâ€™ location on the earth, along with all the earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 4.5 on the map as well as adding the data on an additional third (dark) map.

JavaScript and the D3.js library were used to retrieve the coordinates and magnitudes of the earthquakes from the GeoJSON data.
Likewise Leaflet library was used to plot the data on a Mapbox map through an API request and create interactivity for the earthquake data.

### Deliverables

The project includes three major deliverables
1.	Deliverables 1: Add Tectonic Plate Data

2.	Deliverables 2: Add Major Earthquake Data

3.	Deliverables 3: Add an Additional Map

### Resources

1.	Earthquake datas in GeoJSON were retrieved from USGS website. 
  
    a.	Earthquakes for the last seven days (https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/all_week.geojson)
  
    b.	Earthquakes greater than 4.5 magnitude (https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/4.5_week.geojson)

2.	Tectonic Plate Boundaries in GeoJSON was retrieved from (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fraxen/tectonicplates/master/GeoJSON/PB2002_boundaries.json)

### Results

1.	Tectonic Plate Map with earthquake of past 7 days.
